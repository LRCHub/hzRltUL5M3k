I watched you change
Into a fly oh
I looked away
You were on fire
I watched a change in you
Like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed
And I watched a change in you
Like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
Like you never had wings
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
I look at the cross
Then I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away
I watched a change in you
Like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
And you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel so alive
I've watched you change
Like you never had wings
Ahh ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You change You change
You change I'm over
